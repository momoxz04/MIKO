                I wanted to create a Website with a calming effect which isn't overloaded with stuff
                and it should also have a lot of white spacing. The Theme something very simple; jsut a website
                to take privat notes on. U log in to get to ur notes and that's pretty much it.^^

                I am now in year 2 of my apprenticeship. We had HTML and CSS before and now also JS but it's by far
                the most difficult one yet. We didn't really get to know the basics so it was hard as hell to understand smth.
                Actually working with js helped so much more than just listening to the inputs.
